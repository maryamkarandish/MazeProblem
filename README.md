# MazeProblem
---
in this code the initial matrix represents the path and obstacles, the path is represented as 0 and obstacles represented as -1

We want to find the optimal path, so the priority is given to the biggest index (i+1, j+1). If there is an obstacle, then try another path.

Every time we check that we are in the table and the value for x and y is valid.
